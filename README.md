# Tic-Tac-Toe


**App's Purpose**

I built a Tic Tac Toe application using Svelte to showcase my skills in creating interactive applications and applying logical thinking. The game logic is implemented using a multi-dimensional array, and the game state is tracked within the application. The unique feature of this project is that it allows for gameplay against a robot, demonstrating my ability to combine technical prowess with creative problem-solving.
